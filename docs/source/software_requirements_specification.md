# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for DataWeaver

## 1. Introduction
DataWeaver is a powerful and flexible library designed to simplify the process of building data synchronization pipelines between various systems using any stream processing library. The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the DataWeaver system.

## 2. Purpose
The main objectives of DataWeaver are:
- To provide a simple and intuitive way to connect various data sources and sinks.
- To promote code reusability and modularity in building data synchronization pipelines.
- To enable scalability and fault tolerance in data processing.
- To facilitate data transformations and manipulations within the data pipeline.
- To support various data formats and serialization mechanisms.
- To facilitate testing and monitoring of data synchronization pipelines.

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 Use Case: Building a Data Synchronization Pipeline
- **Actor**: Developer
- **Description**: The developer wants to build a data synchronization pipeline to transfer data from a source system to a sink system.
- **Steps**:
    1. The developer installs DataWeaver library.
    2. The developer defines a source connector by extending the `SourceConnector` base class and implementing the required methods.
    3. The developer defines a sink connector by extending the `SinkConnector` base class and implementing the required methods.
    4. The developer creates a `ConnectorPipeline` instance, specifying the source and sink connectors.
    5. The developer configures the pipeline with any additional settings or transformations.
    6. The developer starts the pipeline, which begins reading data from the source, applying transformations, and writing data to the sink.
- **Alternate Flows**:
    - If an error occurs during pipeline execution, DataWeaver should handle the error gracefully and provide appropriate error messages and logging.
    - If the data volume increases significantly, DataWeaver should be able to scale the pipeline by adding more worker instances to handle the increased load.

### 3.2 Use Case: Performing Data Transformations
- **Actor**: Developer
- **Description**: The developer wants to perform data transformations within the data synchronization pipeline.
- **Steps**:
    1. The developer defines a custom connector by extending the `SourceConnector` or `SinkConnector` base class.
    2. The developer implements the `process` method in the connector to apply data transformations.
    3. The developer specifies the desired data transformations, such as filtering, mapping, or aggregation.
    4. The developer configures the pipeline to use the custom connector.
    5. When the pipeline is executed, DataWeaver applies the specified transformations to the data flowing through the pipeline.
- **Alternate Flows**:
    - If the data transformations are complex or resource-intensive, DataWeaver should optimize the transformations to minimize overhead and improve performance.

### 3.3 Use Case: Monitoring Pipeline Health and Performance
- **Actor**: Developer, Operations Team
- **Description**: The developer or operations team wants to monitor the health and performance of the data synchronization pipeline.
- **Steps**:
    1. DataWeaver is configured to enable monitoring and logging.
    2. DataWeaver collects metrics and logs related to the pipeline execution, such as throughput, latency, and error rates.
    3. The collected metrics and logs are stored in a monitoring system or log aggregation tool.
    4. The developer or operations team uses monitoring dashboards or query tools to analyze the pipeline health and performance.
    5. Based on the analysis, the developer or operations team identifies any performance bottlenecks or issues and takes necessary actions to optimize the pipeline.
- **Alternate Flows**:
    - If the monitoring system detects any anomalies or critical issues, it should trigger alerts or notifications to the relevant stakeholders for prompt action.
