# High-Level Design (HLD) for DataWeaver

## 1. Introduction
This High-Level Design (HLD) document provides a detailed overview of the system architecture for DataWeaver, a flexible and powerful library for building data synchronization pipelines. It breaks down the major components of the system, presents architecture and data flow diagrams, and describes the interfaces between the components.

## 2. System Architecture
The system architecture of DataWeaver follows a modular and extensible design, enabling developers to create custom connectors and pipelines while leveraging the capabilities of the underlying stream processing framework. The architecture is composed of the following major components:

```

### 2.1 DataWeaver Library
The DataWeaver Library is the core component of the system. It provides a set of abstractions and utilities for building data synchronization pipelines. The library interacts with the stream processing framework and exposes a simple and intuitive API for developers to create and manage connectors and pipelines.

### 2.2 Stream Processing Framework
DataWeaver integrates with a stream processing framework, such as Apache Kafka or Apache Flink, to handle the underlying data processing and communication with external systems. The stream processing framework provides the necessary infrastructure for data ingestion, processing, and delivery.

### 2.3 Connector
The Connector is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all connectors in the framework. It specifies the methods that connectors must implement, such as `read()`, `process()`, and `write()`. Developers create custom connectors by extending this base class and providing the necessary implementation for these methods.

### 2.4 Source Connector
The Source Connector is responsible for reading data from external systems and producing messages into the data pipeline. It extends the Connector base class and implements the `read()` method to retrieve data from the source system.

### 2.5 Sink Connector
The Sink Connector is responsible for consuming messages from the data pipeline and writing data to external systems. It extends the Connector base class and implements the `write()` method to store data in the sink system.

### 2.6 Connector Pipeline
The Connector Pipeline represents a data synchronization pipeline that connects a source connector to a sink connector. It orchestrates the flow of data from the source to the sink, handling message processing, transformation, and error handling.

### 2.7 Data Serialization
DataWeaver provides utilities for data serialization and deserialization, supporting various data formats such as JSON, Avro, and Protobuf. It abstracts away the details of data serialization and deserialization, providing a consistent interface for working with data regardless of the underlying format.

### 2.8 Error Handling
DataWeaver includes error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure data integrity and resilience. It provides configurable error handling strategies and retry policies to handle failures and transient issues during data synchronization.

## 3. Data Flow Diagram
The following data flow diagram illustrates the flow of data through the DataWeaver system:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[External Source System] --> B[Source Connector]
    B --> C[Stream Processing Framework]
    C --> D[Sink Connector]
    D --> E[External Sink System]
```

1. Data is ingested from an external source system into the Source Connector.
2. The Source Connector reads the data and produces messages into the stream processing framework.
3. The stream processing framework processes the messages and routes them to the Sink Connector.
4. The Sink Connector consumes the messages and writes the data to an external sink system.

## 4. Component Descriptions

### 4.1 DataWeaver Library

## 5. Interfaces

### 5.1 DataWeaver Library API
The DataWeaver Library exposes a simple and intuitive API for developers to create and manage connectors and pipelines. The API includes methods for configuring connectors, creating pipelines, starting and stopping data synchronization, and handling errors.

Key methods:
- `create_connector(config)`: Creates a new connector instance based on the provided configuration.
- `create_pipeline(source_connector, sink_connector)`: Creates a new pipeline instance connecting the specified source and sink connectors.
- `start_pipeline(pipeline)`: Starts the data synchronization process for the specified pipeline.
- `stop_pipeline(pipeline)`: Stops the data synchronization process for the specified pipeline.
- `handle_error(error)`: Handles errors that occur during data synchronization.

### 5.2 Connector Interface
The Connector interface defines the methods that all connectors must implement. It serves as a contract between the DataWeaver Library and the individual connectors.

Key methods:
- `read()`: Reads data from the external system (implemented by source connectors).
- `process(data)`: Processes and transforms the data (implemented by both source and sink connectors).
- `write(data)`: Writes data to the external system (implemented by sink connectors).

### 5.3 Stream Processing Framework Interface
DataWeaver integrates with the stream processing framework through its provided interface. The exact interface depends on the specific stream processing framework being used (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Flink).

Common methods:
- `create_stream(config)`: Creates a new stream based on the provided configuration.
- `publish(message)`: Publishes a message to the stream.
- `subscribe(topic, callback)`: Subscribes to a specific topic and registers a callback function to handle received messages.
