## 1. Background

Python is the main dynamic language used at Oceans Edge. This style guide is a list of dos and don’ts for Python programs. To help you format code correctly, use tools like Black or Pyink to avoid arguing over formatting.

---

## 2. Python Language Rules

### 2.1 Lint

#### 2.1.1 Definition

`pylint` is a tool for finding bugs and style problems in Python source code. It checks the code against a set of rules and provides feedback on potential issues and areas for improvement.

#### 2.1.2 Pros

- Catches easy-to-miss errors like typos and using variables before assignment.
- Helps maintain a consistent coding style across the codebase.
- Encourages best practices and adherence to coding standards.

#### 2.1.3 Cons

- `pylint` isn’t perfect and may sometimes produce false positives or require code modifications that do not align with the project’s needs.
- Requires configuration to fit the specific style and needs of the project.
- Can be time-consuming to address all warnings and errors, especially in large codebases.

#### 2.1.4 Decision

Make sure you run `pylint` on your code. Suppress warnings if they are inappropriate so that other issues are not hidden. Use `pylint` as part of the development workflow to catch errors early and maintain code quality.

**Do:**
```python
def do_PUT(self):  # WSGI name, so pylint: disable=invalid-name
    ...
```

**Don't:**
```python
def do_PUT(self):
    # Bad practice: not suppressing pylint warnings or fixing the issue
    ...
```

### 2.2 Imports

#### 2.2.1 Definition

Imports are a reusability mechanism for sharing code from one module to another. They allow you to bring in functions, classes, and variables from other modules or packages.

#### 2.2.2 Pros

- Simplifies code reuse and modularity by allowing you to import only the necessary components.
- The namespace management convention is simple, making it clear where each identifier comes from.
- Helps avoid code duplication by allowing shared functionality across multiple modules.

#### 2.2.3 Cons

- Module names can still collide, leading to potential conflicts.
- Some module names are inconveniently long, making code harder to read.
- Overuse of wildcard imports can pollute the namespace and lead to ambiguity.

#### 2.2.4 Decision

- Use `import x` for importing packages and modules.
- Use `from x import y` where x is the package prefix and y is the module name with no prefix.
- Use `from x import y as z` in specific circumstances such as naming conflicts or long names.
- Avoid wildcard imports (`from x import *`).

**Do:**
```python
import os
from datetime import datetime
from collections import defaultdict
```

**Don't:**
```python
from os import *
import datetime as dt
from collections import *
```

### 2.3 Packages

#### 2.3.1 Definition

Packages are a way of organizing related modules into a hierarchical structure, allowing for better code organization and namespace management.

#### 2.3.2 Pros

- Avoids conflicts in module names or incorrect imports due to the module search path.
- Improves code organization and readability by grouping related modules together.
- Makes it easier to manage larger codebases by providing a clear structure.

#### 2.3.3 Cons

- Makes it harder to deploy code because you have to replicate the package hierarchy.
- Can introduce complexity in managing package dependencies and imports.
- May require additional setup and configuration for package management tools.

#### 2.3.4 Decision

All new code should import each module by its full package name to avoid conflicts and improve clarity.

**Do:**
```python
import myproject.utilities.helpers
```

**Don't:**
```python
from helpers import utility_function
```

### 2.4 Exceptions

#### 2.4.1 Definition

Exceptions are a means of breaking out of normal control flow to handle errors or other exceptional conditions. They provide a way to signal that an error has occurred and to handle it appropriately.

#### 2.4.2 Pros

- The control flow of normal operation code is not cluttered by error-handling code, making the code more readable.
- Allows for centralized error handling, making it easier to manage and debug.
- Can provide detailed error messages and stack traces to aid in debugging.

#### 2.4.3 Cons

- May cause the control flow to be confusing, especially if exceptions are used excessively or inappropriately.
- Can lead to hidden bugs if exceptions are not properly handled or documented.
- Performance overhead of raising and catching exceptions.

#### 2.4.4 Decision

- Use built-in exception classes when appropriate to maintain consistency and clarity.
- Do not use assert statements in place of conditionals, as they may be disabled in production code.
- Do not use catch-all `except:` statements unless you are re-raising the exception or creating an isolation point in the program where exceptions are recorded and suppressed.

**Do:**
```python
try:
    result = some_function()
except ValueError as e:
    handle_value_error(e)
```

**Don't:**
```python
try:
    result = some_function()
except:
    handle_error()
```

### 2.5 Mutable Global State

#### 2.5.1 Definition

Mutable global state refers to module-level values or class attributes that can get mutated during program execution. These are variables that can be changed and are accessible from multiple parts of the code.

#### 2.5.2 Pros

- Occasionally useful for maintaining state across different parts of the application.
- Can simplify code by providing a central place to store and access shared data.
- Useful for configuration settings or constants that need to be accessible globally.

#### 2.5.3 Cons

- Breaks encapsulation and can make module behavior unpredictable and harder to debug.
- Increases the risk of unintended side effects and race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
- Makes testing and maintaining the

code more difficult due to dependencies on global state.

#### 2.5.4 Decision

Avoid mutable global state. If necessary, declare mutable global entities at the module level or as a class attribute and make them internal by prepending an `_` to the name to indicate they are for internal use only.

**Do:**
```python
class MyClass:
    _internal_state = []

    @classmethod
    def add_state(cls, value):
        cls._internal_state.append(value)
```

**Don't:**
```python
global_state = []

def add_state(value):
    global_state.append(value)
```

### 2.6 Nested/Local/Inner Classes and Functions

#### 2.6.1 Definition

A class or function can be defined inside of another method, function, or class. These nested entities are only accessible within the scope in which they are defined.

#### 2.6.2 Pros

- Allows definition of utility classes and functions that are only used inside of a very limited scope, promoting encapsulation.
- Can reduce namespace pollution by keeping auxiliary functions and classes local to their context.
- Provides a way to close over local variables, creating closures that can maintain state between function calls.

#### 2.6.3 Cons

- Nested functions and classes cannot be directly tested, making it harder to write unit tests.
- Can make the code harder to read and understand, especially if overused or deeply nested.
- May lead to confusion about the scope and accessibility of the nested entities.

#### 2.6.4 Decision

Avoid nested functions or classes except when closing over a local value other than `self` or `cls`. Do not nest a function just to hide it from users of a module.

**Do:**
```python
def outer_function(value):
    def inner_function():
        return value * 2
    return inner_function()
```

**Don't:**
```python
def outer_function():
    def inner_function():
        # No need for nesting here
        pass
    return inner_function()
```

### 2.7 Comprehensions & Generator Expressions

#### 2.7.1 Definition

Comprehensions and generator expressions provide a concise way to create container types and iterators without traditional loops. They include list comprehensions, set comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and generator expressions.

#### 2.7.2 Pros

- Simple comprehensions can be clearer and simpler, making the code more readable.
- Can lead to more compact and expressive code, reducing the number of lines and potential for errors.
- Often more efficient than equivalent loops, especially for large data sets.

#### 2.7.3 Cons

- Complicated comprehensions can be hard to read and understand, defeating their purpose.
- May lead to overuse and misuse, making the code less readable and maintainable.
- Nested comprehensions and multiple filter expressions can be particularly difficult to follow.

#### 2.7.4 Decision

Comprehensions are allowed, but multiple for clauses or filter expressions are not permitted. Use comprehensions for simple cases and prefer traditional loops for more complex scenarios.

**Do:**
```python
squares = [x * x for x in range(10)]
```

**Don't:**
```python
complicated_comprehension = [x * x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 for y in range(5)]
```

### 2.8 Default Iterators and Operators

#### 2.8.1 Definition

Container types define default iterators and membership test operators, allowing for concise and readable code when working with these types.

#### 2.8.2 Pros

- Default iterators and operators are simple and efficient, leveraging the built-in capabilities of container types.
- Makes the code more readable and expressive by using familiar constructs like for loops and in operators.
- Reduces boilerplate code, improving maintainability.

#### 2.8.3 Cons

- You can’t tell the type of objects by reading the method names, which can lead to ambiguity.
- Over-reliance on default iterators and operators may hide the complexity of the underlying operations.
- Can lead to subtle bugs if the container is modified during iteration.

#### 2.8.4 Decision

Use default iterators and operators for types that support them. Do not mutate a container while iterating over it to avoid unintended side effects.

**Do:**
```python
for item in my_list:
    process(item)
```

**Don't:**
```python
for item in my_list:
    my_list.append(item * 2)
```

### 2.9 Generators

#### 2.9.1 Definition

A generator function returns an iterator that yields a value each time it executes a yield statement. Generators are a convenient way to implement iterators without the overhead of storing all values in memory at once.

#### 2.9.2 Pros

- Simpler code and less memory usage, as values are generated on the fly.
- Can handle large data sets efficiently by generating values one at a time.
- Provides a clean way to implement iterators with complex logic.

#### 2.9.3 Cons

- Local variables in the generator will not be garbage collected until the generator is consumed, potentially leading to memory leaks.
- Can be harder to understand and debug compared to regular functions.
- May lead to issues if the generator is not properly exhausted or cleaned up.

#### 2.9.4 Decision

Use "Yields:" in the docstring for generator functions. If the generator manages an expensive resource, ensure proper cleanup by using the context management protocol or finalization methods.

**Do:**
```python
def count_up_to(max):
    """Yields numbers from 1 to max."""
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1
```

**Don't:**
```python
def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    numbers = []
    while count <= max:
        numbers.append(count)
        count += 1
    return numbers
```

### 2.10 Lambda Functions

#### 2.10.1 Definition

Lambdas define anonymous functions in an expression. They are often used for short, throwaway functions that are not reused elsewhere in the code.

#### 2.10.2 Pros

- Convenient for simple operations and can make the code more concise.
- Useful for short callbacks or when passing simple functions as arguments.
- Reduces the need to define separate named functions for small operations.

#### 2.10.3 Cons

- Harder to read and debug than local functions, especially for complex logic.
- Limited functionality compared to regular functions, as they can only contain a single expression.
- Overuse can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain.

#### 2.10.4 Decision

Lambdas are allowed for simple cases. If the code inside the lambda function spans multiple lines or is longer than 60-80 characters, it might be better to define it as a regular nested function.

**Do:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
```

**Don't:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: (x ** 2) + (x ** 3) - (2 * x) + 1, numbers))
```

### 2.11 Conditional Expressions

#### 2.11.1 Definition

Conditional expressions provide a shorter syntax for if statements. They are also known as ternary operators.

#### 2.11.2 Pros

- Shorter and more convenient than an if statement, making the code more concise.
- Can improve readability for simple conditions by keeping the logic inline with the expression.
- Reduces the need for multi-line if statements for straightforward conditions.

#### 2.11.3 Cons

- May be harder to read than an if statement, especially for complex conditions.
- Can lead to overly compact code that sacrifices readability for brevity.
- Not suitable for conditions that require multiple actions or complex logic.

#### 2.11.4 Decision

Okay to use for simple cases. Use a complete if statement when things get more complicated or when multiple actions are required.

**Do:**
```python
value = 'Yes' if condition else 'No'
```

**Don't:**
```python
value = ('Yes' if condition1 else 'No') if condition2 else ('Maybe' if condition3 else 'Never')
```

### 2.12 Default Argument Values

#### 2.12.1 Definition

Default argument values allow you to specify values for parameters at the end of a function’s parameter list. If the caller does not provide a value for these parameters, the default value is used.

#### 2.12.2 Pros

- Provides an easy way to override default values without having to specify them each time.
- Makes function calls simpler and more flexible by allowing optional parameters.
- Reduces the need for overloading functions or creating multiple versions of the same function.

#### 2.12.3 Cons

- Default arguments are evaluated once at module load time, which may cause problems if the argument is a mutable object.
- Can lead to unexpected behavior if the default value is modified during the function execution.
- May hide the need for certain parameters, making the function signature less clear.

#### 2.12.4 Decision

Do not use mutable objects as default values. Use `None` and initialize within the function to avoid unintended side effects.

**Do:**
```python
def append_to_list(value, my_list=None):
    if my_list is None:
        my_list = []
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list
```

**Don't

:**
```python
def append_to_list(value, my_list=[]):
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list
```

### 2.13 Properties

#### 2.13.1 Definition

Properties wrap method calls for getting and setting an attribute as a standard attribute access. They allow you to control access to instance variables and add additional logic if necessary.

#### 2.13.2 Pros

- Allows for an attribute access and assignment API, making the code cleaner and more intuitive.
- Provides a way to add validation or side-effects to attribute access without changing the interface.
- Can be used to make computed attributes look like regular attributes.

#### 2.13.3 Cons

- Can hide side-effects and be confusing for subclasses if not documented properly.
- May lead to unexpected behavior if the property logic is complex or not intuitive.
- Overuse can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

#### 2.13.4 Decision

Properties are allowed but should match the expectations of typical attribute access. Use them to encapsulate instance variables and provide a clean interface.

**Do:**
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value

    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, value):
        self._value = value
```

**Don't:**
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value

    def get_value(self):
        return self._value

    def set_value(self, value):
        self._value = value
```

### 2.14 True/False Evaluations

#### 2.14.1 Definition

Python evaluates certain values as False in a boolean context. These include `None`, `False`, numeric zero, empty sequences, and empty mappings.

#### 2.14.2 Pros

- Conditions using Python booleans are easier to read and less error-prone.
- Makes the code more concise by leveraging implicit truthiness and falsiness.
- Reduces the need for explicit comparisons, improving readability.

#### 2.14.3 Cons

- May look strange to developers from other languages where explicit comparisons are more common.
- Can lead to confusion if the implicit truthiness or falsiness of certain values is not well understood.
- Overuse can make the code less clear, especially for complex conditions.

#### 2.14.4 Decision

Use the implicit false if possible. Always use `if foo is None:` to check for a `None` value to avoid ambiguity.

**Do:**
```python
if not my_list:
    print("List is empty")
```

**Don't:**
```python
if len(my_list) == 0:
    print("List is empty")
```

### 2.15 Lexical Scoping

#### 2.15.1 Definition

A nested Python function can refer to variables defined in enclosing functions. This concept is known as lexical scoping, where the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code.

#### 2.15.2 Pros

- Results in clearer, more elegant code by allowing inner functions to access outer function variables.
- Provides a way to create closures that can maintain state between function calls.
- Encourages the use of functional programming techniques, promoting immutability and purity.

#### 2.15.3 Cons

- Can lead to confusing bugs if the scope and lifetime of variables are not well understood.
- May make the code harder to read and understand, especially for complex nesting.
- Can introduce subtle side-effects if the outer scope variables are modified within the inner function.

#### 2.15.4 Decision

Okay to use lexical scoping, but be mindful of the potential for confusing bugs. Document the use of closures and ensure that the scope and lifetime of variables are clear.

**Do:**
```python
def outer_function(value):
    def inner_function():
        return value * 2
    return inner_function()
```

**Don't:**
```python
def outer_function(value):
    def inner_function():
        nonlocal value
        value = value * 2
    inner_function()
    return value
```

### 2.16 Function and Method Decorators

#### 2.16.1 Definition

Decorators are for converting ordinary methods into dynamically computed attributes. They allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code.

#### 2.16.2 Pros

- Elegantly specifies some transformation on a method, making the code more modular and reusable.
- Encourages the use of higher-order functions and separation of concerns.
- Can be used to add cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and caching without modifying the core logic.

#### 2.16.3 Cons

- Decorators can perform arbitrary operations on a function’s arguments or return values, making the code harder to understand and debug.
- Overuse can lead to code that is difficult to follow and maintain, especially with multiple nested decorators.
- May introduce unexpected side-effects if not used carefully.

#### 2.16.4 Decision

Use decorators judiciously. Avoid `staticmethod` unless forced. Use `classmethod` only for named constructors or class-specific routines. Document the purpose and behavior of each decorator.

**Do:**
```python
def log_execution(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_execution
def my_function():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

**Don't:**
```python
def log_execution(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Executing {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    @log_execution
    def my_static_method():
        print("Hello, world!")
```

### 2.17 Threading

#### 2.17.1 Definition

Python’s built-in data types may not be atomic. The `queue` module provides a thread-safe `Queue` data type that is the preferred way to communicate data between threads.

#### 2.17.2 Pros

- The `queue` module’s `Queue` data type provides a safe and convenient way to manage data exchange between threads.
- Simplifies the implementation of producer-consumer patterns and other common threading scenarios.
- Helps avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues by providing thread-safe operations.

#### 2.17.3 Cons

- Atomicity of built-in data types should not be relied upon, as operations may not be thread-safe.
- Managing threads and synchronization can be complex and error-prone, especially for larger applications.
- Requires careful design and testing to ensure proper synchronization and avoid deadlocks.

#### 2.17.4 Decision

Use the `queue` module’s `Queue` data type for thread-safe data exchange. Use the `threading` module and its locking primitives to manage concurrency and synchronization.

**Do:**
```python
import threading
import queue

def worker(q):
    while True:
        item = q.get()
        if item is None:
            break
        process(item)
        q.task_done()

q = queue.Queue()
threads = []
for i in range(4):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(q,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

# Add tasks to the queue
for item in range(10):
    q.put(item)

# Block until all tasks are done
q.join()

# Stop workers
for i in range(4):
    q.put(None)
for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

**Don't:**
```python
import threading

def worker(global_list):
    while True:
        if not global_list:
            break
        item = global_list.pop(0)
        process(item)

global_list = list(range(10))
threads = []
for i in range(4):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(global_list,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

### 2.18 Power Features

#### 2.18.1 Definition

Python’s powerful language features, such as metaclasses, dynamic attribute access, and introspection, can make code more compact and flexible.

#### 2.18.2 Pros

- These features are powerful and allow for highly dynamic and flexible code.
- Can be used to implement advanced patterns and frameworks, reducing boilerplate and increasing expressiveness.
- Enables the creation of domain-specific languages and other high-level abstractions.

#### 2.18.3 Cons

- Harder to read, understand, and debug compared to more straightforward code.
- Can introduce subtle bugs and unexpected behavior if not used carefully.
- May lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend, especially for new developers or contributors.

#### 2.18.4 Decision

Avoid these features in your code unless absolutely necessary. Prefer more straightforward and readable constructs to maintain code clarity and maintainability.

**Do:**
```python
# Use clear and readable constructs
def func(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x * 2
    else:
        return x - 2
```

**Don't:**
```python
# Avoid using overly compact features
def func(x):
    return (x * 2 if x > 0 else x - 2)
```

### 2.19 Modern Python: from future imports

#### 2.19.1 Definition

`from future` imports enable new language features on a per-file basis. These imports allow you to use features from future Python versions while maintaining compatibility with the current version.

#### 2.19.2 Pros

- Makes runtime version upgrades smoother by allowing gradual adoption of new features.
- Helps

ensure forward compatibility and prepares the codebase for future Python releases.
- Encourages the use of modern language features, improving code quality and performance.

#### 2.19.3 Cons

- Such code may not work on very old interpreter versions, limiting compatibility.
- Can introduce confusion if team members are not familiar with the future imports being used.
- May require additional testing and validation to ensure compatibility with different Python versions.

#### 2.19.4 Decision

Use `from future` imports to enable modern features. Ensure that all team members are aware of the features being used and test the code for compatibility across supported Python versions.

**Do:**
```python
from __future__ import annotations
from __future__ import division

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
    return a / b
```

**Don't:**
```python
# Avoid using features without `from future` imports in older codebases
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
```

### 2.20 Type Annotated Code

#### 2.20.1 Definition

Type annotations provide a way to specify the expected types for function or method arguments and return values. They improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.

#### 2.20.2 Pros

- Improves readability and maintainability by clearly specifying expected types.
- Helps catch type-related errors early, reducing bugs and improving code quality.
- Can be used with type checkers like `mypy` to enforce type safety across the codebase.

#### 2.20.3 Cons

- Keeping type declarations up to date can be cumbersome, especially in large codebases.
- May introduce additional complexity for functions with complex or dynamic behavior.
- Can lead to longer function signatures, making the code harder to read if overused.

#### 2.20.4 Decision

Include type annotations and enable checking via `pytype` in the build system. Use type annotations judiciously to balance readability and maintainability.

**Do:**
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

```python
def process_data(data):
    processed_data = step_one(data)
    processed_data = step_two(processed_data)
    return step_three(processed_data)
```

**Don't:**
```python
def process_data(data):
    processed_data = step_one(data)

Certainly! Here is the enhanced Section 4, incorporating the guidance on implementing interfaces, creating abstract classes that inherit from those interfaces, and then concrete implementations that inherit from the abstracts:

## 4. Interfaces and Implementation Classes

### 4.1 Interface Classes

#### 4.1.1 Definition

Interface classes should be defined using abstract base classes (ABCs) from the `abc` module. They define a contract that concrete classes must follow.

#### 4.1.2 Pros

- Promotes loose coupling and flexibility in code design by defining clear contracts.
- Encourages the use of multiple implementations and polymorphism.
- Improves code readability and maintainability by clearly defining expected behaviors.

#### 4.1.3 Cons

- Can introduce additional complexity if overused or not needed.
- Requires careful design to ensure the interfaces are intuitive and useful.
- May lead to confusion if the interface hierarchy is too deep or complex.

#### 4.1.4 Decision

Use abstract base classes to define interfaces. Name interface classes with a prefix `I` (e.g., `IExampleInterface`) to indicate their purpose.

**Do:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IExampleInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def method_one(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def method_two(self, param: str) -> int:
        pass
```

**Don't:**
```python
class IExampleInterface:
    def method_one(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def method_two(self, param):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### 4.2 Abstract Base Classes

#### 4.2.1 Definition

Abstract base classes should inherit from the interface class and can define common behavior for concrete implementations. They provide a base for concrete classes to build upon.

#### 4.2.2 Pros

- Allows for shared code among multiple concrete implementations, reducing duplication.
- Provides a clear and consistent structure for implementing common behaviors.
- Can enforce certain behaviors and properties across all concrete implementations.

#### 4.2.3 Cons

- May lead to tight coupling if not used judiciously, reducing flexibility.
- Can introduce complexity if the abstract base class hierarchy is too deep.
- Requires careful design to ensure the abstract base class remains useful and relevant.

#### 4.2.4 Decision

Use abstract base classes to provide shared functionality for concrete classes. Name abstract classes with a prefix `Abstract` (e.g., `AbstractExample`) to indicate their purpose.

**Do:**
```python
class AbstractExample(IExampleInterface):
    def method_one(self) -> None:
        # Common implementation or leave abstract
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def method_two(self, param: str) -> int:
        # Common implementation or leave abstract
        pass
```

**Don't:**
```python
class AbstractExample:
    def method_one(self) -> None:
        # Common implementation or leave abstract
        pass

    def method_two(self, param: str) -> int:
        # Common implementation or leave abstract
        pass
```

### 4.3 Concrete Implementations

#### 4.3.1 Definition

Concrete classes should inherit from the abstract base class and implement all abstract methods. They provide specific implementations for the defined behaviors.

#### 4.3.2 Pros

- Ensures all necessary methods are implemented, adhering to the defined contract.
- Allows for specific behavior tailored to different use cases and requirements.
- Encourages code reuse and modularity by leveraging the abstract base class.

#### 4.3.3 Cons

- Overhead of implementing all abstract methods, even if not all are needed.
- Can lead to rigidity if the abstract base class is not designed with flexibility in mind.
- May introduce complexity if there are too many concrete implementations.

#### 4.3.4 Decision

Implement all methods defined in the interface and abstract base class. Use descriptive names for concrete classes related to their functionality.

**Do:**
```python
class ConcreteExample(AbstractExample):
    def method_one(self) -> None:
        # Concrete implementation
        print("Method one implementation")

    def method_two(self, param: str) -> int:
        # Concrete implementation
        return len(param)
```

**Don't:**
```python
class ConcreteExample:
    def method_one(self) -> None:
        # Concrete implementation
        print("Method one implementation")

    def method_two(self, param: str) -> int:
        # Concrete implementation
        return len(param)
```

### 4.4 Example Usage

#### 4.4.1 Definition

Demonstrate the use of interfaces, abstract base classes, and concrete implementations through example code.

**Do:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IDataProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_data(self, data: str) -> str:
        pass

class AbstractDataProcessor(IDataProcessor):
    def process_data(self, data: str) -> str:
        # Common implementation (if any)
        pass

class UpperCaseDataProcessor(AbstractDataProcessor):
    def process_data(self, data: str) -> str:
        return data.upper()

class LowerCaseDataProcessor(AbstractDataProcessor):
    def process_data(self, data: str) -> str:
        return data.lower()

# Using the concrete implementations
upper_processor = UpperCaseDataProcessor()
lower_processor = LowerCaseDataProcessor()

print(upper_processor.process_data("Hello World"))  # Output: HELLO WORLD
print(lower_processor.process_data("Hello World"))  # Output: hello world
```

**Don't:**
```python
class DataProcessor:
    def process_data(self, data):
        raise NotImplementedError

class UpperCaseDataProcessor(DataProcessor):
    def process_data(self, data):
        return data.upper()

class LowerCaseDataProcessor(DataProcessor):
    def process_data(self, data):
        return data.lower()

# Using the concrete implementations
upper_processor = UpperCaseDataProcessor()
lower_processor = LowerCaseDataProcessor()

print(upper_processor.process_data("Hello World"))  # Output: HELLO WORLD
print(lower_processor.process_data("Hello World"))  # Output: hello world
```

### 4.5 Naming Conventions for Interfaces and Abstracts

#### 4.5.1 Pros

- Clear and consistent naming conventions improve readability and maintainability.
- Helps distinguish between different types of classes and their roles.
- Facilitates code review and collaboration by adhering to a common vocabulary.

#### 4.5.2 Cons

- None identified.

#### 4.5.3 Decision

- Interface classes should be prefixed with `I` (e.g., `IExampleInterface`).
- Abstract classes should be prefixed with `Abstract` (e.g., `AbstractExample`).
- Concrete implementations should use descriptive names related to their functionality (e.g., `ConcreteExample`).

## 5. Parting Words

Use common sense and BE CONSISTENT. If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If their comments have little boxes of stars around them, make your comments have little boxes of stars around them too. The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying, rather than on how you are saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try to avoid this.

## 6. Summary

This style guide outlines the essential conventions for writing Python code and structuring interface and implementation classes. Following these guidelines will help maintain code readability, consistency, and modularity, especially when working in collaborative environments or large codebases.
