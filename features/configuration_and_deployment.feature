Feature: Configuration and Deployment
  As a developer
  I want to easily configure and deploy DataWeaver pipelines
  So that I can manage my data synchronization workflows effectively

  Scenario: Configuring DataWeaver settings
    Given I have DataWeaver installed
    When I provide configuration settings
    Then DataWeaver should apply the configuration to the pipelines and connectors

  Scenario: Deploying DataWeaver pipelines
    Given I have configured DataWeaver pipelines
    When I deploy the pipelines
    Then DataWeaver should start the pipelines and begin data synchronization
    And DataWeaver should handle the deployment process seamlessly
